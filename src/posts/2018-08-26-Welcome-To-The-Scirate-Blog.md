Welcome to the new official blog of <a href="https://scirate.com">SciRate</a>.

I've started this blog for a few purposes:

1. Engagement with people that use SciRate,
2. Provide status updates,
3. Provide commentary on topics that are of interest to us,
4. Be a platform for people that want to contribute to the ecosystem.

I'd like to hear from you, the users of SciRate, for what you'd
like to see here. You can reach me via
[email](mailto:noonsilk+scirate@gmail.com). One idea I'd like to explore is
guest blog-posts providing coverage of particular research areas.

Thanks!
